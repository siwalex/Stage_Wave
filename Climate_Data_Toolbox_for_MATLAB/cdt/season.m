function [As,ts] = season(A,t,varargin) 
% season estimates anomalies associated with the annual cycle or of a time series. 
% 
%% Syntax 
% 
%  [As,ts] = season(A,t) 
%  [As,ts] = season(...,'daily')  
%  [As,ts] = season(...,'monthly') 
%  [As,ts] = season(...,'detrend',DetrendOption) 
%  [As,ts] = season(...,'dim',dimension) 
%  As = season(...,'full') 
% 
%% Description 
% 
% [As,ts] = season(A,t) gives the typical seasonal (aka annual) cycle of the time series A corresponding
% to times t in datenum format. If t is daily, outputs ts is 1 to 366 and As will contain average values
% for each of the 366 days of the year. If inputs are monthly, ts is 1:12 and As will contain average values
% for each of the 12 months of the year. 
%
% [As,ts] = season(...,'daily') specifies directly that inputs are daily resolution. The season function
% will typically figure this out automatically, but if you have large missing gaps in your data you may wish
% to ensure correct results by specifying daily. 
% 
% [As,ts] = season(...,'monthly') as above, but forces monthly solution. 
%
% [As,ts] = season(...,'detrend',DetrendOption) specifies a baseline relative to which seasonal anomalies are 
% determined. Options are 'linear', 'quadratic', or 'none'. By default, anomalies are calculated after 
% removing the linear least squares trend, but if, for example, warming is strongly nonlinear, you may prefer
% the 'quadratic' option. Default is 'linear'. 
%
% [As,ts] = season(...,'dim',dimension) specifies a dimension along which to assess seasons. By default, 
% if A is 1D, seasonal cycle is returned along the nonsingleton dimension; if A is 2D, season is performed
% along dimension 1 (time marches down the rows); if A is 3D, season is performed along dimension 3. 
% 
% As = season(...,'full') returns As for the entire time series A. This is a convenient option for looking
% at the components of a long time series separately.
