% 
% Welcome to the Climate Data Toolbox for Matlab! Here are some tips 
% on getting started with CDT:

%% CDT Contents
% For a complete list of CDT functions, datasets, and tutorials, check out the 
% <CDT_Contents.html *CDT Contents*> page. 

%% Downloading CDT 
% You have a few options for downloading CDT. You can get the most recent
% release of the toolbox <http://chadagreene.com/ClimateDataToolbox.mltbx
% here> (about 100 MB) and just double-click on the file to install it (described 
% below) or you can find all the latest individual files through the
% Add-Ons menu (Method 2 described below), on the
% <https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/ Mathworks File
% Exhange> or on <https://github.com/chadagreene/CDT GitHub>.

%% Installing CDT in Matlab
% You have two options for how to install CDT:
% 
% 1. If you have already downloaded
% the .mltbx file, navigate to it in your file system and it might look something
% like this: 
% 
% <<cdt_install_screenshot_1.png>>
% 
% Just double-click on that file and when the menu pops up, click *Install*. 
% Installation should take less than a second. 
% 
% 2. Alternatively, if you haven't already downloaded the mltbx file, you can get 
% it via the Add-On button from directly within Matlab. That looks
% like this in the HOME menu: 
% 
% <<cdt_install_screenshot_2.png>>
% 
% Click *Get Add-Ons*, look up _Climate Data Toolbox_, and follow the prompts to download
% and install CDT automatically. 
%
%% Accessing Help 
% Need help? Just type 
% 
%  cdt
% 
% to access TMD documentation. For help with specific functions, type
% |cdt| followed by the function name. For example, 
% 
%  cdt eof 
% 
% to access help for the |eof| function. 
% 
% Still need help? 
% 
% * The fastest way to get help is to ask a question on the <https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/index
% Matlab Answers forum.> 
% * If you find a bug or experience some other technical issue that the Answers
% forum cannot solve, please report it via the <https://github.com/chadagreene/CDT/issues
% CDT Issues page>. 
% * You can also try emailing me directly at chad@chadagreene.com. I can't promise a response, 
% but I do read all the messages I receive. To maximize your chances of receiving a response, 
% please describe the issue you're experiencing, describe what you're _trying_ to accomplish, 
% include any error messages, and *provide a minimal working example* if applicable.
