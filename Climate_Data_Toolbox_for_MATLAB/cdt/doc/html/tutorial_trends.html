</pre><p>The warning message occurred because the units of <tt>t</tt> (datenum) are very different from the units of C02 (ppm). You see, the values of t are very large compared to the values of C02. To illustrate this point, look at the first element of <tt>t</tt>:</p><pre class="codeinput">t(1)
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">ans =
     720626.00
</pre><p>That's a very big number. It's the number of days since New Years Day of the year 0. A quick and easy way to deal with this big number is to convert it to decimal year using the <a href="doy_documentation.html"><tt>doy</tt></a> function:</p><pre class="codeinput">yr = doy(t,<span class="string">'decimalyear'</span>);
</pre><p>Now the first date looks like this:</p><pre class="codeinput">yr(1)
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">ans =
       1973.01
</pre><p>And that number is small enough that we can fit a polynomial to it and the C02 data. Divide <tt>yr</tt> by 10 to get polynomials relative to decades rather than years:</p><pre class="codeinput">P = polyfit(yr(isf)/10,C02(isf),2)

          1.26       -486.24      47162.38
</pre><p>The positive value in the first element <tt>P</tt> tells us something we already knew: Atmospheric C02 is not just increasing, it is <i>accelerating.</i></p><h2 id="22">3D datasets</h2><p>The examples above looked at 1D arrays, each representing a single time series. In climate science, we often work with thousands of such time series all at once, in the form of gridded data. In these kinds of 3D grids, the first two dimensions are typically spatial, like longitude and latude, and the third dimension corresponds to time. Each grid cell contains its own time series, and one way to work with those time series is to loop through each grid cell, performing 1D analysis on the time series of each grid cell. We'll cover that method a bit farther down in this tutorial, but first we will use the <a href="trend_documentation.html"><tt>trend</tt></a> function to calculate the trend of the 3D dataset.</p><p>Begin by loading the data</p><pre class="codeinput">load <span class="string">pacific_sst</span>

  t         802x1                     6416  double              

</pre><p>The pacific_sst sample dataset contains 802 monthly sea surface temperatures on a 60x55 grid. The grid resolution is quite coarse, and it only covers part of the Pacific, but it's worth noting that even this small dataset contains 60x55=3300 individual time series. While it may be tempting to loop through each grid cell, computing the trend of each grid cell's time series individually, we should think of that method as the last resort, because it's a mighty slow way of going about things. So whenever you can, try to avoid loops and just operate once.</p><p>The <tt>trend</tt> function does the whole operation at once. Here's how to use it:</p><pre class="codeinput"><span class="comment">% Calculate the trend per year, for 12 samples per year (monthly data):</span>
tr = trend(sst,12);

<span class="comment">% Plot the linear trend:</span>

</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="tutorial_trends_07.png" alt=""> <p>The <tt>trend</tt> calculation above was fast, because it only had to do the calculation once, not 3300 times. (It uses <a href="cube2rect_documentation.html"><tt>cube2rect</tt></a> to reshape the sst dataset, then performs the least squares fit, then uses <a href="rect2cube_documentation.html"><tt>rect2cube</tt></a> to "un-reshape" the results.)</p><h2 id="25">Dealing with NaNs in a 3D dataset</h2><p>In some instances, you may have no choice but to use loops to calculate trends in a 3D gridded dataset. For example, if there are some scattered <tt>NaN</tt> values in the data. In such cases, loop through each row and column of the 3D dataset, determine which time indices are finite in each grid cell, and calculate the trend accordingly. Don't forget to <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/preallocating-arrays.html">preallocate</a> before starting the loops.</p><pre class="codeinput"><span class="comment">% Preallocate:</span>

% <CDT_Contents.html Back to Climate Data Tools Contents>
% 
% <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares Least-squares linear regression> is one of the most common types of 
% analysis in the Earth sciences, and Matlab's <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_(mathematics)#Left_and_right_division 
% left-divide operator> which enables efficient least-squares computation is a big reason Matlab originally gained 
% popularity among geoscientists. The mathematics of least squares and
% matrix multiplication is well covered online and in many textbooks, so
% this tutorial just covers the mechanics of how to calculate least squares
% regressions using the Climate Data Toolbox for Matlab. 

%% The |trend| function 
% For this example we'll make some random data with a known trend, and then
% we'll use the <trend_documentation.html |trend|> function to fit a linear
% least-squares regression to the data. First, generate the data: 

x = 1:1000; 
y = 5*x + 500*randn(size(x)) + 300; 

%% 
% Above, we imposed a trend of y = 5*x, then added some noise and a
% y-intercept of 300. Here's the data: 

plot(x,y,'o')

%% 
% Use <polyplot_documentation.html |polyplot|> to quickly plot the first-order least-squares trend: 

hold on
polyplot(x,y,1,'linewidth',2) 

%% 
% Most often in the geosciences, the question is, what's the slope of that
% line? How does y vary with x? We know that the slope should be about
% y=5*x, but what does least squares say? Use the <trend_documentation.html
% |trend|> function to find out: 

trend(y,x) 

%% 
% About 5. That's exactly the answer we expected. 

%% The |polyfit| and |polyval| functions
% The |trend| function is convenient due to its simplicity, but you may
% wish for more information than just the slope of the trend line. For
% example, you might want to know the y-intercept or some higher-order
% least-squares fit. For such occasions, the standard Matlab function
% |polyfit| may come in handy. 
% 
% The |polyfit| function fits any order polynomial to a dataset by least
% squares. Fitting a first-order polynomial to the x,y data with |polyfit|
% looks like this: 

P = polyfit(x,y,1)

%% 
% Above, |P| contains the coefficients of the polynomials, starting with
% the highest order. Since this is a first-order least squares fit, the
% contents of |P| are |[P_1 P_0]|, or the slope and the intercept,
% respectively. So it is not surprising that the slope |P_1| is about 5 and
% the intercept |P_0| is about 300. Those are the values we imposed when we
% created |y|. If we wanted to get the coefficients of a second-order fit, we'd use

P = polyfit(x,y,2) 

%% 
% However, fitting a second order or higher to this particular dataset
% would not be appropriate, and we know it, because when we defined |y| we
% said that it has a slope, a y-intercept, and noise, and nothing else.
% That means to fit even a second-order polynomial |y| would be fitting the
% model to noise. That's sometimes called over-fitting. 
% 
% To illustrate overfitting, let's fit a 25th-order polynomial to |y|: 

P = polyfit(x,y,25); 

%% 
% Now use the |polyval| function to evaluate the 25th-order |P| for every
% |x| and plot it as a thick black line: 

y_overfit = polyval(P,x); 

plot(x,y_overfit,'k','linewidth',2) 

legend('raw data','1^{st} order fit','25^{th} order fit',...
   'location','northwest')

%% Trends in atmospheric C02
% Now let's apply the method above to assess changes in atmospheric C02
% measured at Mauna Loa, Hawaii. Start by loading the data and plotting: 

load mlo_daily_c02.mat

figure
plot(t,C02)
axis tight 
datetick('x','keeplimits') % formats x ticks as dates
ylabel('atmospheric C02 (ppm)')

%% 
% Throughout this time of measurement, at what rate has atmospheric C02
% increased? Find out using the <trend_documentation.html |trend|>
% function: 

trend(C02,t)

%% 
% |NaN| means not-a-number. That's because the C02 dataset contains some |NaN| values.
% This is common in real datasets, which sometimes have gaps or missing
% data, but there's an easy way to deal with it. Just determine which
% elements of the |C02| datasets are finite, and only analyze those. 

% Determine which C02 indices are not NaN: 
isf = isfinite(C02); 

% Calculate the trend among finite values: 
trend(C02(isf),t(isf))

%% 
% A trend of about zero does not seem like much of a trend at all. But
% note, the |trend| function calculated the changes in C02 per unit of
% time, and the time units are datenum, which are days. (Read more about
% date formats in <tutorial_dates_and_times.html this tutorial>.) So it is
% not surprising that the trend in C02 (ppm) per day is close to zero. A
% more meaningful measure might be the trend per decade. 
% 
% To convert the C02 trend from ppm/day to ppm/decade, just multiply by
% 365.25 days per year, and then multiply that by 10 years per decade: 

trend(C02(isf),t(isf))*365.25*10

%% 
% The trend in atmospheric C02 is about 17 ppm per decade in this dataset. 
% Use <polyplot_documentation.html |polyplot|> to show the trend line on
% the plot: 

hold on
polyplot(t,C02,1) 

%% 
% In the plot above, we see that the first-order fit of about 17 ppm per
% decade matches the overall trend of course, but it doesn't fully capture
% the long-term shape of the curve. Here's where it may be appropriate to
% use a higher-order fit. Let's show a second-order fit: 

polyplot(t,C02,2)
legend('raw data','1^{st} order fit','2^{nd} order fit',...
   'location','northwest') 

%% 
% The corresponding polynomial constants can be found with the |polyfit|
% function: 

P = polyfit(t(isf),C02(isf),2);

%% 
% The warning message occurred because the units of |t| (datenum) are very
% different from the units of C02 (ppm). You see, the values of t are very
% large compared to the values of C02. To illustrate this point, look at
% the first element of |t|: 

t(1) 

%% 
% That's a very big number. It's the number of days since New Years Day of the 
% year 0. A quick and easy way to deal with this big number is to convert
% it to decimal year using the <doy_documentation.html |doy|> function: 

yr = doy(t,'decimalyear'); 

%% 
% Now the first date looks like this: 

yr(1)

%% 
% And that number is small enough that we can fit a polynomial to it and
% the C02 data. Divide |yr| by 10 to get polynomials relative to decades
% rather than years: 

P = polyfit(yr(isf)/10,C02(isf),2)

%% 
% The positive value in the first element |P| tells us something we already
% knew: Atmospheric C02 is not just increasing, it is _accelerating._

%% 3D datasets
% The examples above looked at 1D arrays, each representing a single time
% series. In climate science, we often work with thousands of such time
% series all at once, in the form of gridded data. In these kinds of 3D
% grids, the first two dimensions are typically spatial, like longitude and
% latude, and the third dimension corresponds to time. Each grid cell
% contains its own time series, and one way to work with those time series
% is to loop through each grid cell, performing 1D analysis on the time
% series of each grid cell. We'll cover that method a bit farther down in
% this tutorial, but first we will use the <trend_documentation.html
% |trend|> function to calculate the trend of the 3D dataset.
% 
% Begin by loading the data 

load pacific_sst

whos lat lon sst t % displays variable sizes

%% 
% The pacific_sst sample dataset contains 802 monthly sea surface temperatures
% on a 60x55 grid. The grid resolution is quite coarse, and it only covers
% part of the Pacific, but it's worth noting that even this small dataset
% contains 60x55=3300 individual time series. While it may be tempting to
% loop through each grid cell, computing the trend of each grid cell's time 
% series individually, we should think of that method as the last resort,
% because it's a mighty slow way of going about things. So whenever you
% can, try to avoid loops and just operate once. 
% 
% The |trend| function does the whole operation at once. Here's how to use
% it:  

% Calculate the trend per year, for 12 samples per year (monthly data):
tr = trend(sst,12); 

% Plot the linear trend: 
figure
imagescn(lon,lat,tr) 
cb = colorbar; 
ylabel(cb,'SST trend (\circC yr^{-1})') 
cmocean('balance','pivot') % sets the colormap with zero in the middle

%% 
% The |trend| calculation above was fast, because it only had to do the
% calculation once, not 3300 times. (It uses <cube2rect_documentation.html
% |cube2rect|> to reshape the sst dataset, then performs the least squares
% fit, then uses <rect2cube_documentation.html |rect2cube|> to "un-reshape"
% the results.) 
% 
%% Dealing with NaNs in a 3D dataset
% In some instances, you may have no choice but to use loops to calculate
% trends in a 3D gridded dataset. For example, if there are some scattered
% |NaN| values in the data. In such cases, loop through each row and column
% of the 3D dataset, determine which time indices are finite in each grid
% cell, and calculate the trend accordingly. Don't forget to <https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/preallocating-arrays.html
% preallocate> before starting the loops. 

% Preallocate: 
sst_trend = nan(60,55); 

% Loop through each row: 
for row = 1:60
   
   % Loop through each column: 
   for col = 1:55
      
      % Get the time indices of finite data in this grid cell: 
      ind = isfinite(sst(row,col,:)); 
      
      % Only calculate the trend if there are at least two finite indices:
      if sum(ind)>=2
         sst_trend(row,col) = trend(squeeze(sst(row,col,ind)),t(ind))*365.25; 
      end
   end
end
     
%% 
% Note the |squeeze| command above, which converts the 1x1xN arrays into
% Nx1 arrays. 
% 
% Now plot the sst_trend which we just calculated on a per-grid-cell basis,
% just confirm that it matches the results of using |trend| on the whole
% dataset at once: 

figure
imagescn(lon,lat,sst_trend) 
cb = colorbar; 
ylabel(cb,'SST trend (\circC yr^{-1})') 
cmocean('balance','pivot') % sets the colormap with zero in the middle
