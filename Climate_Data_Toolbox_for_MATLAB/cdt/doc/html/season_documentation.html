%% Description 
% 
% |[As,ts] = season(A,t)| gives the typical seasonal (aka annual) cycle of the time series |A| corresponding
% to times |t| in datenum or datetime format. If |t| is daily, outputs |ts| is 1 to 366 and |As| will contain average values
% for each of the 366 days of the year. If inputs are monthly, |ts| is 1:12 and |As| will contain average values
% for each of the 12 months of the year. 
%
% |[As,ts] = season(...,'daily')| specifies directly that inputs are daily resolution. The season function
% will typically figure this out automatically, but if you have large missing gaps in your data you may wish
% to ensure correct results by specifying daily. 
% 
% |[As,ts] = season(...,'monthly')| as above, but forces monthly solution. 
%
% |[As,ts] = season(...,'detrend',DetrendOption)| specifies a baseline relative to which seasonal anomalies are 
% determined. Options are |'linear'|, |'quadratic'|, or |'none'|. By default, anomalies are calculated after 
% removing the linear least squares trend, but if, for example, warming is strongly nonlinear, you may prefer
% the |'quadratic'| option. Default is |'linear'|. 
%
% |[As,ts] = season(...,'dim',dimension)| specifies a dimension along which to assess seasons. By default, 
% if |A| is 1D, seasonal cycle is returned along the nonsingleton dimension; if |A| is 2D, season is performed
% along dimension 1 (time marches down the rows); if |A| is 3D, season is performed along dimension 3. 
% 
% |As = season(...,'full')| returns |As| for the entire time series |A|. This is a convenient option for looking
% at the components of a long time series separately. 
%

% You can see the temperature has a seasonal cycle, but there's a gradual warming over time
% and there's also some random noise in there. To see the structure of the seasonal cycle a 
% little better, we can look at the same time series as a function of day of year using 
% the <doy_documentation.html |doy|> function. We'll also use the <cbdate_documentation.html |cbdate|> 
% function to format the colorbar dates.

% of the seasonal cycle, and it's pretty close. 

%% Example 2: Multiple time series at once 
% Let's say you have several rows of data, each containing a different time series. 
% The data might look like this (we're building on the time series |T| from above)

T2 = [T + (t-min(t))/2e3;
      T - 15*cos(doy(t,'decimalyear')*2*pi) + (t-min(t))/1e2;

% because each row of |T2| contains a time series. If each column of |T2| contained a time series, 
% the default dimension 1 would be what we want.

% Let's also get the whole time series with the |'full'| option rather than the default days 1 to 366.

%% Example 3: Real Sea Ice Data
% The examples above used some artifical data we created. But how does this function apply to
% real data? Let's compare the northern and southern hemisphere seasonal cycles of sea ice
% extent. Here's what the full time series look like: 

load seaice_extent

figure
plot(t,extent_N,'b')
hold on
plot(t,extent_S,'r')

axis tight
box off
legend('north','south','location','northwest') 

%% 
% So what's a typical year of sea ice look like?

figure
plot(season(extent_N,t),'b')
hold on
plot(season(extent_S,t),'r')

axis tight
box off
xlabel 'day of year'
ylabel('sea ice extent anomaly (10^6 km^2)') 
ntitle(' typical seasonal cycle ')
legend('north','south','location','northwest') 

%% Example 4: Gridded reanalysis data
% Let's explore the typical seasonal cycles of sea surface temperatures. Here's a monthly 
% dataset of dimensions 60x55x802: 

load pacific_sst 

sst_season = season(sst,t); 

%% 
% That gives us |sst_season|, which is 60x55x12, representing one 60x55 grid for each month of the
% year. Take the difference between the typical maximum and minimum temperatures to get a sense 
% of how strong the seasons are in different parts of the Pacific: 

T_range = max(sst_season,[],3)-min(sst_season,[],3); 

figure
imagescn(lon,lat,T_range)
cb = colorbar; 
ylabel(cb,'magnitude of seasonal cycle (\circ C)') 
cmocean amp

%% 
% That's not surprisingREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHSeasonality is strongest close to the poles and in shallow waters. 

%% How this function works
% By default, the |season| function removes the linear trend from a time series, then determines the climatology
% of the time series by averaging all detrended data for each day (or month) of the year. 
% 
% For daily data, Leap Years present a challenge. This function calculates the average temperature for February 28th
% by averaging all data corresponding to the 59th day of the year. But what to do about March 1st? Most years
% March 1st is the 60th day of the year, but every fourth year March 1st is the 61st day of the year. 
% 
% This function converts all dates to the day of the year, and calculates seasonal cycles as a function of day
% of the year. Since there are far fewer years with 366 days, applying the same practice of averaging all data
% from day 366 would make day 366 sensitive to outliers. Thus, for day 366, the |season| function averages all
% data from day 365, day 366, and day 1 of all years. 

%% Seasons vs Climatology
% CDT has a function called |season| and another function called <climatology_documentation.html |climatology|>. 
% The only difference is that the output of |climatology| includes the mean of the variable, 
% whereas the output of |season| will always have a 0 mean value. Accordingly, the <deseason_documentation.html |deseason|>
% function removes the seasonal component of variability while preserving the overall mean
% and trends. 
% 
% In general, CDT assumes that a multi-year record of a variable sampled at 
% subannual resolution can described by 
% 
%  y = y_0 + y_tr + y_season + y_var + y_noise
% 
%% 
% where 
% 
% * |y_0| is the long-term |mean|, 
% * |y_trend| is the long-term <trend_documentation.html |trend|>, 
% * |y_season| is the typical seasonal anomaly, which the |season| function obtains after detrending and removing the mean, 
% * |y_var| represents interannual variability, and 
% * |y_noise| is everything else 
% 
% In this model, 
% 
%  y_climatology = y_0 + y_season
%
