% |sinefit_bootstrap| performs a bootstrap analysis on the parameters
% estimated by the function <sinefit_documentation.html |sinefit|>. Bootstrapping means applying the 
% |sinefit| function to a bunch of subsamples of the data, then analyzing
% the distributions of solutions for each parameter to see how robust
% the solutions are.

%% Syntax
% 
%  ft = sinefit_bootstrap(t,y)
%  ft = sinefit_bootstrap(...,'weight',weights) 
%  ft = sinefit_bootstrap(...,'terms',TermOption) 
%  ft = sinefit_bootstrap(...,'nboot',nboot)
%  [ft,rmse,Nsamp] = sinefit_bootstrap(...)
% 
%% Description 
% 
% |ft = sinefit_bootstrap(t,y)| fits a 2-term (amplitude and phase) sinusoid 
% to 1000 random subsamples of the time series |t,y|. The output |ft| is a 1000x2
% matrix containinng all 1000 solutions for the amplitude and phase, respectively. 
% See <sinefit_documentation.html |sinefit|> for a complete description of inputs and outputs. 
% 
% |ft = sinefit_bootstrap(...,'weight',w)| applies weighting to each of the observations
% |y|. For example, if formal errors |err| are associated with |y|, you might 
% let |w = 1./err.^2|. By default, |w = ones(size(y))|. 
% 
% |ft = sinefit_bootstrap(...,'terms',TermOption)| specifies which terms are calculated
% in the sinusoid fit. Default is |2| because more terms can be computationally slow! 
% |TermOption| can be 2, 3, 4, or 5:
% 
% * |2|: |ft = [A doy_max]| where |A| is the amplitude of the sinusoid, and |doy_max| 
%      is the day of year corresponding to the maximum value of the sinusoid. 
%      The default |TermOption| is |2|.
% * |3|: |ft = [A doy_max C]| also estimates |C|, a constant offset. Solving for  
%      adds processing time, so you may prefer to estimate |C| on your own simply
%      as the mean of the input |y|. However, if you can't assume C=mean(y), you
%      may prefer this three-term solution. 
% * |4|: |ft = [A doy_max C trend]| also estimates a linear trend over the entire
%      time series in units of y per year. Again, simultaneously solving for 
%      four terms will be much more computationally expensive than solving for
%      two yerms, so you may prefer to estimate the trend on your own with 
%      polyfit, then calculate the two-term sine fit on your detrended data. 
% * |5|: |ft = [A doy_max C trend quadratic_term]| also includes a quadratic term
%      in the solution, but this is experimental for now, because fitting a 
%      polynomial to dates referenced to year zero tends to be scaled poorly.
%
% |ft = sinefit_bootstrap(...,'nboot',nboot)| specifies the number of bootstrap samples. 
% Default is |1000|, meaning sinusoids are fit to 1000 random subsamples of the data.  
%
% |[ft,rmse,Nsamp] = sinefit_bootstrap(...)| also returns distributions of root-mean-square
% error of residuals (how well the sinusoids fit the data) and |Nsamp|, the number
% of datapoints contributing to each subsample of the data. 
% 
%% Example
% This example performs a bootstrap analysis of the phase and amplitude of
% a sea ice extent dataset. Load and plot the northern hemisphere sea ice 
% extent time series: 

load seaice_extent

plot(t,extent_N) 
box off
axis tight
ylabel 'NH sea ice extent (10^6 km^2)'

%% 
% Well that's about like interpreting a barcode. Try plotting
% as a function of day of the year for a better depiction of the
% seasonal cycle. I'm using my <https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/48413-cbdate |cbdate|>
% function for a date-formatted colorbar.   

figure
scatter(day(t,'dayofyear'),extent_N,10,datenum(t),'filled')
axis tight
box off
xlabel 'day of year'
cb = cbdate('yyyy'); 
set(cb,'ydir','reverse') % flips the direction of the colorbar

%% 
% Now the |sinefit| function can estimate the amplitude, phase, 
% y-intercept, and slope of that time series all at once; however, 
% computation gets quite a bit slower with every extra term, and |sinefit_bootstrap| 
% will have to do the calculation a thousand times, so let's just detrend
% the data now for simplicity, and only solve for the phase and amplitude . 
% The detrended time series looks like this: 

y = detrend(extent_N); 

figure
plot(t,y) 
box off
axis tight
ylabel 'detrended NH sea ice extent (10^6 km^2)'

%% 
% By eye we can see the amplitude of the sinusoid is about 4 million km^2, 
% and this is the northern hemisphere sea ice extent, so we can guess that
% its maximum will be at the end of northern hemisphere winter or the spring. 
% We can fit a 2-term sinusoid to the full time series to get something better
% than an eyeball estimation: 

sinefit(t,y)

%% 
% Those two numbers, 4.4 and 66.8, are the amplitude of the sinusoid and 
% the day that the sinusoid reaches its maximum value. That is, 4.4 million km^2 and
% day 66 (March 7th). But how robust is that solution? Use |sinefit_bootstrap|
% to fit sinusoids to 1000 random samples of the sea ice extent time series
% (This solution will take about 20 seconds) 

ft = sinefit_bootstrap(t,y); 

amp = ft(:,1);  % amplitude is the first column of ft
phase = ft(:,2);% phase is the second column of ft 

%% 
% If you have the Statistics Toolbox, you can use |scatterhist| to display 
% the distributions of amplitude and phase solutions. Otherwise, you can 
% just plot them in 2D as a scatterplot and/or plot the histograms of the 
% individual distributions of the data: 

scatterhist(phase,amp)
xlabel 'day of sinusoid maximum'
ylabel 'amplitude (10^6 km^2)'

%% 
% Those are pretty tight clusters. They say that the amplitude and phase 
% of the sinusoid fit should be accurate within about

std(amp) 
std(phase) 

%% 
% 0.009 km^2 and 0.1 days. That's not surprising, given that we have 40 years (40 cycles)
% of a very well sampled (365/cycle) dataset, we expect high accuracy of the |sinefit|
% amplitude and phase. But what if you only have a few data points, collected at random times? 
% Can you still estimate a sinusoid? Here's what I mean: Let's trim down the dataset to just 
% 7 random points: 

% Indices of 7 random data points:  
ind = randi(length(y),[7 1]); 

% Trim y and t to only those 7 points:
y = y(ind); 
t = t(ind); 

figure
plot(t,y,'bo') 
axis tight
box off 
ylabel 'NH sea ice extent (km^2)'

%%
% That only looks like a few random points. But once again, plotting as a function of  
% day of year can help us see what |sinefit| has to work with: 

figure
scatter(day(t,'dayofyear'),y,60,datenum(t),'filled')
axis tight
box off
xlabel 'day of year'
colorbar
cbdate('yyyy'); 

%% 
% So we see that |sinefit| has something like a sinusoid to approximate, 
% even with only 7 points. It should not be surprising that with just these
% 7 points, |sinefit| still gets values pretty close to the well-constrained 
% 4.4 amplitude with a maximum on day 66.8

ft = sinefit(t,y)

%% 
% Here's what the sinusoid looks like on top of those 7 points: 

hold on
plot(1:365,sineval(ft,1:365))

%% 
% Use |sinefit_bootstrap| to quantify the uncertainty. 

ft = sinefit_bootstrap(t,y); 

figure
scatterhist(ft(:,2),ft(:,1))
xlabel 'day of sinusoid maximum'
ylabel 'amplitude (km^2)'

amp_uncertainty = std(ft(:,1)) 
phase_uncertainty = std(ft(:,2))

%%
% And indeed, even with just 7 datapoints collected over 40 years, |sinefit| 
% can estimate the amplitude within about 0.4 million km^2 and the phase within about 7 days. 

%% Note to users
% One brief note related to the all the parameters estimated by |sinefit|: These parameters 
% describe the best-fit sinusoid, but that does not necessarily mean they fully
% describe the behavior of the underlying data itself. For example, in terms of climatological average, 
% Northern Hemisphere sea ice extent actually typically reaches a maximum around day 71 (March 12), 
% whereas |sinefit| says the maximum value of the best-fit sinusoid occurs on day 66 (March 7). That's 
% because the true behavior of sea ice extent is more complex than a simple sinusoid. In your work, be sure
% to consider the difference between true behavior and the 1/yr frequency component of the true behavior.
